== Description ==

Display tweets from a Twitter account in the sidebar of your blog.

This plugin was not support for over 2 years, i've noticed that it is getting
bigger the day it passes, so i've decided to relunch it. For those who used it
and they've been unpleased, please accept my appologies and update this plugin!

If the widgets already runs, and you update the settings, please allow
30 minutes to take effect, this is because of the cache it uses.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `rehashs-twitter-widget.zip`
2. Upload `rehashs-twitter-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Place the widget on your sidebar
5. Edit the widget by adding a Tilte type in your Twitter username and type a count number of how many tweets to display
